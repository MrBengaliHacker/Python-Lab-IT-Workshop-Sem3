## ðŸ“‹Program 1: Student Dictionary

**Question**: Write a Python program to create a dictionary of 5 students with their roll numbers as keys and names as values. Print the dictionary.

**Solution**: [View Code](Program_1.py)

```python
# Create an empty dictionary
students = {}

# Take input for 5 students
for i in range(5):
    roll = int(input(f"Enter roll number of student {i+1}: "))
    name = input(f"Enter name of student {i+1}: ")
    students[roll] = name   # Add roll number as key and name as value

print("\nStudent Dictionary:")
print(students)
```
### OUTPUT

```
Enter roll number of student 1: 101
Enter name of student 1: Ram
Enter roll number of student 2: 102
Enter name of student 2: Shyam
Enter roll number of student 3: 103
Enter name of student 3: Jodu
Enter roll number of student 4: 104
Enter name of student 4: Modhu
Enter roll number of student 5: 105
Enter name of student 5: Kodu

Student Dictionary:
{101: 'Ram', 102: 'Shyam', 103: 'Jodu', 104: 'Modhu', 105: 'Kodu'}
```
## ðŸ“‹Program 2: Fruit Price Dictionary

**Question**: Create a dictionary of fruits with their prices. Ask the user to input a fruit name and print its price. If the fruit is not available, display "Not Found".

**Solution**: [View Code](Program_2.py)

```python
# Dictionary of fruits with prices
fruits = {
    "mango": 90,
    "banana": 40,
    "apple": 120,
    "grapes": 70,
    "pineapple": 150
}

fruit_name = input("Enter the fruit name: ").lower()

# Check availability
if fruit_name in fruits:
    print(f"The price of {fruit_name} is: {fruits[fruit_name]}")
else:
    print("Not Found")
```
### OUTPUT

```
Enter the fruit name: Pineapple
The price of pineapple is: 150
```
```
Enter the fruit name: Berry
Not Found
```
## ðŸ“‹Program 3: Add and Update Dictionary

**Question**: Write a program to add a new keyâ€“value pair in a dictionary and update the value of an existing key.

**Solution**: [View Code](Program_3.py)

```python
# Sample dictionary
my_dict = {
    "name": "Ritam",
    "age": 19,
    "branch": "CSE"
}

# Print original dictionary
print("Original dictionary:")
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Adding a new key-value pair
my_dict["college"] = "Bengal Institute of Technology"

# Updating the value of an existing key
my_dict["age"] = 20

# Print updated dictionary
print("\nUpdated dictionary:")
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```
### OUTPUT

```
Original dictionary:
name: Ritam
age: 19
branch: CSE

Updated dictionary:
name: Ritam
age: 20
branch: CSE
college: Bengal Institute of Technology
```
## ðŸ“‹Program 4: Merge Two Dictionaries with Summed Values

**Question**: Write a program to merge two dictionaries into one. If a key is present in both, sum their values.

Example:

d1 = {'a': 10, 'b': 20}
d2 = {'b': 30, 'c': 40}
Output â†’ {'a': 10, 'b': 50, 'c': 40}

**Solution**: [View Code](Program_4.py)

```python
# Two dictionaries
d1 = {'a': 10, 'b': 20}
d2 = {'b': 30, 'c': 40}

# Merging dictionaries
merged_dict = d1.copy()  # Start with d1

for key, value in d2.items():
    if key in merged_dict:
        merged_dict[key] += value  # Sum values if key exists
    else:
        merged_dict[key] = value   # Add new key-value pair

print("Merged dictionary:", merged_dict)
```
### OUTPUT

```
Merged dictionary: {'a': 10, 'b': 50, 'c': 40}
```
## ðŸ“‹Program 5: Sort Dictionary by Keys and Values

**Question**: Create a dictionary of items and their prices. Sort the dictionary by:

Keys (alphabetical order)

Values (ascending order of prices)

**Solution**: [View Code](Program_5.py)

```python
# Dictionary of items with prices
shop_items = {
    "chocolate": 25,
    "milk": 50,
    "bread": 30,
    "butter": 80,
    "eggs": 60
}

# Print original dictionary
print("Original Dictionary :", shop_items)

# Sort dictionary by keys (alphabetical order)
sorted_by_keys = dict(sorted(shop_items.items()))
print("\nSorted By Keys :", sorted_by_keys)

# Sort dictionary by values (ascending order)
sorted_by_values = dict(sorted(shop_items.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))
print("\nSorted By Values:", sorted_by_values)
```
### OUTPUT

```
Original Dictionary : {'chocolate': 25, 'milk': 50, 'bread': 30, 'butter': 80, 'eggs': 60}

Sorted By Keys : {'bread': 30, 'butter': 80, 'chocolate': 25, 'eggs': 60, 'milk': 50}

Sorted By Values: {'chocolate': 25, 'bread': 30, 'milk': 50, 'eggs': 60, 'butter': 80}
